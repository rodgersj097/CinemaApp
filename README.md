# CinemaApp
This is a simple app that uses the Jsoup library to scrape https://www.cineplex.com/Showtimes/any-movie/galaxy-cinemas-barrie?Date=
and https://www.cineplex.com/Showtimes/any-movie/cineplex-cinemas-north-barrie?Date= and show the movies listed under the "grid__item no-page-break-inside" class. This will get the movie title and times. The app will update the url with the currrent date formatted to ciniplex date format to allow for futur use. 
The front end design is limited, I will eventually update it. 
If you want the APK it is in Cinema\app\release\app-release.apk
